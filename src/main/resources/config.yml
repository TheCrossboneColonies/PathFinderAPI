performance:
  # The time in milliseconds between checks for block changes in a chunk.
  # Pathfinding is done asynchronously and therefore uses copies of block data to pathfind with, not the data itself.
  # A higher value here means better performance, but potential inaccuracy.
  # Default: 10000
  chunk_invalidation_time: 10000

visualizers:
  block:
    # The block type to use for visualizing the path, a list of block types can be found here:
    # https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
    # Default: "GOLD_BLOCK"
    block_type: "GOLD_BLOCK"
    
    # The tick delay between updating blocks when visualizing the path.
    # This can be set to zero, but no delay between updating the blocks.
    # Since block generation is done asynchronously, this factor will not cause lag.
    # Default: 2
    block_delay: 2
  particle:
    # The particle color to use when visualizing the path.
    # Default: RGB(255, 255, 0)
    particle_color:
      red: 255
      green: 255
      blue: 0

    # The number of blocks between each particle when visualizing the path.
    # This value can impact performance, a higher value means that there will be less particles to render.
    # Default: 6
    particle_every: 6
